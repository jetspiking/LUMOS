#UI Catalyst Engine

To ensure security while allowing flexibility in swapping the User Interface Layout System:

Define a Clear Interface Specification: Create a well-defined specification for the layout language. Include the types of elements allowed, properties, and interactions. This serves as a contract between the UI Catalyst Engine and the layout files.

Use a Domain-Specific Language (DSL): Implement a DSL for the layout system. This DSL should be restricted to layout descriptions, preventing the execution of arbitrary or harmful code.

Sandboxing: Run the layout parser in a sandbox environment. This restricts the parser's access to the system, preventing potential security breaches from maliciously crafted layout files.

Validation and Sanitization: Implement strict validation of the layout files. Ensure that all input conforms to the expected format and sanitize it to remove potential exploits.

![](https://github.com/jetspiking/LUMOS/blob/main/Design/Cosmetic/Animation/Boot.gif)

# Description
LUMOS is a mock operating system that can be utilized to limit a system to its purpose(s) to enhance the end-user experience. LUMOS can be deployed as a supplement for systems heavily relying on users opening or using specific tools on a Windows, Linux or MacOS machine. A requirement for applying LUMOS is that the workflow can be automated by an API or DLL. Ideally this API would be in C#. However, by creativily calling your API or (CLI) tools in the LUMOS C#-backend, there are many possibilities.

# Thank you for using LUMOS
